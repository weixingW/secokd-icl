p1: {question: "John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is? (A) 50 (B) 45 (C) 65 (D) 78 (E) 64", rational: "If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50.", labels: "(A)"}
p2: {question: "If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.  (A) 1/2 (B) 3/2 (C) 5/2 (D) 4/2 (E) 7/2", rational: "If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.", labels: "(B)"}
p3: {question: "A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?  (A) 53 km (B) 55 km (C) 52 km (D) 60 km (E) 50 km", rational: "The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.", labels: "(E)"}
p4: {question: "How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500? (A) 1156 (B) 1392 (C) 1480 (D) 1562 (E) 1788", rational: "There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.", labels: "(B)"}
p5: {question: "Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other? (A)21 (B)21.5 (C)22 (D)22.5 (E)23", rational: "If Q complete x kilometers, then P completes 1.15x kilometers. x + 1.15x = 43 2.15x=43 x = 43/2.15 = 20 Then P will have have walked 1.15*20=23 km.", labels: "(E)"}
p6: {question: "In the coordinate plane, points (x, 1) and (5, y) are on line k. If line k passes through the origin and has slope 1/5, then what are the values of x and y respectively? (A)4 and 1 (B)1 and 5 (C)5 and 1 (D)3 and 5 (E)5 and 3", rational: "Line k passes through the origin and has slope 1/5 means that its equation is y=1/5*x. Thus: (x, 1)=(5, 1) and (5, y) = (5,1) -->x=5 and y=1.", labels: "(C)"}
p7: {question: "The speed at which a man can row a boat in still water is 25 kmph. If he rows downstream, where the speed of current is 11 kmph, what time will he take to cover 80 metres? (A)18 seconds (B)27 seconds (C)26 seconds (D)12 seconds (E)8 seconds", rational: "Speed of the boat downstream = 25 +11 = 36 kmph = 36 * 5/18 = 10 m/s Hence time taken to cover 80 m = 80/10 = 8 seconds.", labels: "(E)"}
p8: {question: "The entrance fee for a fair is $5 for persons under the age of 18, and 20% more for persons older. Each ride at the fair costs $0.50. If Joe goes with her 6 years old twin brothers, and they each took 3 rides in total. How much money does Joe end up spending at the fair? (A)16 (B)20.5 (C)17.5 (D)20 (E)4.5", rational: "Total entrance fee is (2*$5) + (1.20*5)= $16 Total rides fee is (0.50*3)*3= $4.50 Total money spent is $20.50.", labels: "(B)"}
